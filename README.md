# multistrain_meningitis_model
Computational model of the spread of meningitis in simulated population. This work was done during my masters degree as my primary research project.

To run the model, ensure that you have the necessary files:
death_rate.dat - A file with death rates on a weekly scale
post_UK_contact.dat - Contact matrix from mossong et al 2008
stepsize_3_strain_test.dat - Details the stepsize of the ajustment algorithm
vaccine_program_1.dat - a sample vaccine program file used during vaccine simulations

This program takes in one arguement from command line, the prefix of the file name for all files to be named.
